# Air-Qulity-Prediction

## Project Overview

- The Air Quality Prediction project is a data-driven approach to forecast air quality based on various environmental and meteorological factors. Using machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, this project aims to predict air quality index values, which can be instrumental in taking timely actions to mitigate pollution-related health risks. The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, and the models were evaluated based on key performance metrics.

## Importance of Concept

- Air pollution is a significant environmental risk to health. By predicting air quality, we can help governments and organizations take preventive measures to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants. This project not only demonstrates the application of machine learning in environmental monitoring but also emphasizes the need for accurate prediction models to safeguard public health.



## Impacted Features
- Temperature: Affects pollutant levels, with higher temperatures often increasing ozone formation.
- Wind Speed: Influences the dispersion of pollutants, with higher speeds helping to dilute air pollution.
- Humidity: Impacts particulate matter concentration and smog formation, affecting overall air quality.
- Pressure: Higher atmospheric pressure can trap pollutants close to the ground, worsening air quality.
- Particulate Matter (PM2.5): Fine particles that are harmful to health; their concentration is a direct indicator of air quality.

- The features that showed the highest importance in predicting air quality significantly impact the overall model's performance. By focusing on these features, the model can better capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to more accurate predictions. The models were fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV, further enhancing the performance and reducing errors.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using several metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics helped in determining the models' effectiveness and highlighted areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

- The Air Quality Prediction project is an important step towards leveraging machine learning to monitor and forecast air quality. By focusing on feature importance and model evaluation, this project provides a robust framework for further development in environmental data science.
